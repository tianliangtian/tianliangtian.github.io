# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
## Introduction
### Neural Network
![Neural Network](../../img/Learning/Deep-Learning/Neural-Network.png)
* Use the given input x to predict output y. Inputs are called input layer.
* the circles are called hidden units, use input features to output another features. The units in a column are called a hidden layer.

### Supervised Learning
* Structured Data: Basically databases of data. Each of the features has a defined meaning.
* Unstructured Data: Data like audio, image and text.
### Drivers behind deep learning
* Scale: Large NN performs much better with a large amount of labeled data. `m` denotes number of  training examples
* Algorithms: From sigmoid to ReLU to solve gradient descend.
* Computation
